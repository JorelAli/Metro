# Simple and flexible version control and code syncing
# WORK IN PROGRESS

## Development Setup
Metro is written in C++ and uses CMake. It expects the `LIBGIT_PATH` environment variable to point to
a libgit2 source root.  Libgit2 should be built beforehand. 

## Status and Future
Currently, some basic features are working, but not enough to be able to use in practice.
We're still working on various crucial parts such as syncing and deleting.

Once it's at a useable state, we plan to put work into an alternative Metro UI that allows easy control over repositories.
